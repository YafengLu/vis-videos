# Recordings from IEEE VIS

Recordings from the [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org) conference are posted to [a Vimeo Channel](https://vimeo.com/channels/721847) run by the [VGTC](http://vgtc.org), but this collection of videos is difficult to navigate.

As an initial attempt to address this problem, I created this site to display details fo all of the videos in a filterable table.

It was created quickly, and is imperfect: feel free to send pull requests with improvements.

The details of videos was obtained through the Vimeo API, and then processed to obtain the conference year (from the ``recorded_on`` datetime) and event type (from the video ``name``).

I had been frustrated by Vimeo before, but was prompted into actually creating an index page by [comments on Twitter](https://twitter.com/eagereyes/status/1055075934443839492).
